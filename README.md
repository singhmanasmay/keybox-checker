## More about keyboxes

Android keyboxes are hardware security modules that store cryptographic keys and certificates in tamper-resistant chip storage. They protect sensitive credentials from extraction, even if the device is compromised.

Keyboxes are primarily used for device attestation, hardware-backed encryption operations, DRM content protection, and secure payment services like Google Pay. They create a hardware root of trust that proves device authenticity and ensures cryptographic operations happen on genuine, unmodified devices.
